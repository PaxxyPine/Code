# Ideas
* first person dungeon
* random generated enemenies (slime, zombies, etc)
* player can switch between 3 knives.  Always has one knife activated
* player can inspect knifes
* select monsters
* different weapons do different damage to different enemies
* when player attacks, damage done is resported back
## starting
* first choose main kinfe
    * description on each knife - advantages and disadvantes
    * knives have element attributes
        * fire, wind, water, wood
    * boardswoard is +25% crit
    * crit damage is 100%
* starting stats are all the same

## loot
* enemies drop gold and xp tokens
    * xp tokens can be used for upgrading stats

## dungeons
* will have a map
* players choose what dungeon level they're in
* have to beat previous dungeon (clicker hero style)
* every dungeon will have 5 mons
* armor resets after 2 battles
* wsad dungeon walk, 1st person - monsters randomly appear

## player and monster stats
* player health
* armor hp
* spd - also increases dodge chance
* cr/cd - player only
* attack damage
